PVTUI
=====

**A library for creating terminal/text user interfaces (TUIs) for EPICS.**

    * Build EPICS aware TUIs fast with a readable and declarative API thanks to `FTXUI <https://github.com/ArthurSonzogni/FTXUI>`_
    * As a complete FTXUI application, a PVTUI application supports keyboard and mouse navigation, animations, and more.
    * Built in widgets which abstract EPICS communication details
    * Supports both Channel Access and pvAccess
    * Includes a set of ready-to-use applications (see :ref:`applications`)
